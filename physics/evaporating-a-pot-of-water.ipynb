    "# Evaporating a pot of water\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been given the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Auf einer Herdplatte steht ein Topf mit 850mL Wasser.  Das Wasser hat Anfangs eine Temperatur von 20°C.  Die Herdplatte wird eingeschaltet und liefert 1000 J pro Sekunde.  Berechne, wann das Wasser komplett verdampft ist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the first task is to translate this into a language you know (or\n",
    "know better), for us, the language we know better is English.  Thus, the\n",
    "problem solving process (at a very high level) looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![High-level problem solving process](high-level-problem-solving-process.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a rough path to follow, let's perform the first step:\n",
    "translation into English:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A pot containing 850mL of water is sitting on a stove element. Initially, the water has a temperature of 20°C.  The element is turned on and delivers 1000 J per second.  Calculate when the water is completely evaporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this document is is going to be a \"deep dive\" into the question,\n",
    "so buckle up!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translation notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pull the translation apart a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herdplatte is basically two words Herd (stove) and Platte (plate), where in\n",
    "English the \"plate\" is called an \"element\" or \"hob\" and if it's a gas stove\n",
    "then it's probably called a \"burner\".  An equivalent word in German to\n",
    "'Herdplatte' is 'Kochfeld' which translates literally to \"cook-field\" and\n",
    "would often be used to refer to one of the individual \"fields\" on electric\n",
    "ceramic cooktops (another word for stove in English).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A stove and elements; one element switched on](stove-element.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anfangs basically means \"initially\" or \"in the beginning\" and is related to\n",
    "the noun \"Anfang\" which means \"beginning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The past participle \"eingeschaltet\" literally means \"on-switched\" and hence\n",
    "means that the stovetop element has been turned on.  Note that\n",
    "\"angeschaltet\" and \"eingeschaltet\" mean almost exactly the same thing (if\n",
    "you want to get a German confused, ask them for the difference; they'll\n",
    "usually be stumped for an answer).  Both of these words mean \"on-switched\"\n",
    "(\"ein\" and \"an\" are often used interchangeably where one would use the word\n",
    "\"on\" in English, especially in the sense of turning something on).\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"liefert\" (from the verb \"liefern\") means \"delivers\" and in the\n",
    "sense meant here is that the stovetop element is delivering/providing/giving\n",
    "energy to the pot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Berechne\" is in the imperative mode (meaning this is a command) and means\n",
    "simply \"calculate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The past participle \"verdampft\" is related to the noun \"Dampf\" which means\n",
    "\"steam\" (i.e. water in the gaseous state) and means that the water has\n",
    "completely turned into steam, which in English means \"evaporated\".  Note\n",
    "that the English word contains the noun \"vapour\" (confusingly British\n",
    "English spells \"vapour\" with a \"u\" but \"evaporated\" *without* a \"u\"; in this\n",
    "case American English is more consistent and spells it \"vapor\") which means\n",
    "\"steam\" or \"gaseous water\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can pull apart the question and see if we can solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding useful information in the question\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem solving tip: extract the essential information from the question to\n",
    "reduce the problem to its \"bare bones\".  Also note information about the\n",
    "problem's context that might be relevant to solving the problem.  This is\n",
    "something that takes practice and patience!\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy to solve a problem like the one we have is to read the entire\n",
    "question first before doing anything else to get a high-level overview of\n",
    "what's being asked.  Then we return to the beginning and take each sentence\n",
    "one at a time and pull out the information that might be useful to us and\n",
    "maybe categorise it somehow.  For instance, in the first sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "> A pot containing 850mL of water is sitting on a stove element.\n",
    "\n",
    "the main piece of information is that we have 850mL of water which will be\n",
    "heated up.  The fact that it's in a pot on a stove is only secondary; it\n",
    "could be in a glass flask on a heating element or could be in a plastic bowl\n",
    "in a microwave oven, what's important is that we have a certain amount of\n",
    "water and energy is going to be fed into it to heat it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Initially, the water has a temperature of 20°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The water is at 20°C before anything else happens to it.  This is also a\n",
    "hint that the temperature is going to change somehow and that we've been\n",
    "given a reference temperature for later calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The element is turned on and delivers 1000 J per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairly obviously, 1000 J of energy is being added to the water per second.\n",
    "This is the bit where we realise that it's being heated up, but this tells\n",
    "us exactly how: 1000 J for every second (which, incidentally, is 1000 W; a\n",
    "[Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt) is the amount of energy per unit\n",
    "time, in particular the number of Joules per second).  We know from reading\n",
    "the whole question at the beginning that we have to calculate a time, so\n",
    "having time (i.e. seconds) turn up in one piece of information is very\n",
    "helpful to keep in the back of our heads for the remainder of the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Calculate when the water is completely evaporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important words in this sentence are \"when\" and \"evaporated\".  We've\n",
    "thus been asked for an amount of time (\"when\"; which probably could be more\n",
    "precisely specified as \"how many seconds are required to completely\n",
    "evaporate the water\" or \"how much time will pass before all of the water has\n",
    "evaporated\").  An amount of time links back to the energy rate we have from\n",
    "the previous sentence (1000 J/s is an energy *rate*: it is how much energy\n",
    "per unit time is being added to the system).  The second important word\n",
    "\"evaporated\" tells us the final state of the system, i.e. all of the\n",
    "*liquid* water has been turned into *gaseous* water (steam) and is thus\n",
    "\"gone\" into the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the words from the question, task we've been asked to perform is thus\n",
    "reduced to:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 850mL water, 20°C; 1000 J/s; when evaporated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to write the same thing (Tip: rewording the same question in\n",
    "different ways gives a new perspective and sometimes brings insight into how\n",
    "to solve a given question) would be something like this, where we make time\n",
    "more explicit:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - t<=0: 850mL water at 20°C\n",
    "  - t=0: 1000 J/s\n",
    "  - t=? when water volume is 0mL?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also look at this pictorially:\n",
    "\n",
    "![evaporation process sketch](evaporation-process-sketch2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a rate of energy per unit time, thus if we know how much energy we\n",
    "need to completely evaporate the water, then we can work out how much time\n",
    "that will take (the energy rate is constant, which also makes things easier\n",
    "to calculate).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A physical intuition of the overall evaporation process\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get from water at 20°C to all of it being completely\n",
    "evaporated?  This is a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - heat up the water to 100°C\n",
    "  - convert the liquid water into gaseous water (steam)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there's a simplifying assumption being used here: evaporation\n",
    "doesn't occur until the water has reached 100°C.  We know from experience\n",
    "that water doesn't have to be boiling in order for it to evaporate, however\n",
    "in this case that process is *much slower* than how quickly the water is\n",
    "being heated by the stove element, thus we ignore any evaporation which\n",
    "might be happening as the water is heated from 20°C to 100°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "That might sound a bit weird.  After all, isn't water at 100°C boiling?  And\n",
    "thus it's already turning into steam?  This is true to a degree, however\n",
    "when water is boiling at 100°C it is actually a mixture of liquid and\n",
    "gaseous water[^states-of-matter], both states being at 100°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^states-of-matter]: Note that the [solid, liquid and gaseous states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter) are also called \"phases\", thus one can talk about when water is in the \"gaseous phase\" or equivalently the \"gaseous state\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When water is a gas, the water molecules have so much energy that they don't really\n",
    "interact with one another.  The situation is very different in the liquid\n",
    "state: water molecules are held together by their intermolecular force,\n",
    "which is mostly due to [hydrogen bonding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water#Hydrogen_bonding) but also\n",
    "partially due to the [van der Waals force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force).\n",
    "\n",
    "These bonds look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hydrogen bonding between water molecules](hydrogen-bonding-between-water-molecules.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for liquid water to become a gas, these forces have to be overcome\n",
    "and that takes energy.  Thus, we need two lots of energy to evaporate water:\n",
    "heat it up to boiling point and then break the intermolecular bonds.\n",
    "\n",

    "The specific heat capacity is the amount of energy (per unit mass) that it\n",

    "units of $\\mathrm{J \\cdot kg^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$, where a temperature change\n",

    "water up from 20°C to 100°C.\n",
    "\n",

    "    The formula is \"Temperature in °C\" + 273.15 K= \"Temperature in K\". The\n",
    "    interesting thing to note here is that there is no factor to be applied to\n",
    "    the value of temperature in °C, or, written more explicitly, there is a\n",

    "  - The specific heat capacity is \"spezifische Wärmekapazität\" in German\n",
    "    (note that the concept of \"heat\" in English is translated to \"Wärme\" in\n",

    "Let's try and describe the situation simply in English like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To evaporate all of the water, we need to first get the water boiling and then vaporise the water.  Given the heat capacity of water of 4.2 J/g/K, the temperature difference of 80K and the mass of water (850mL = 850g), it will take $850\\mathrm{g} \\cdot 4.2 \\mathrm{J/g/K} \\cdot 80 \\mathrm{K} = 285600\\mathrm{J}$ to boil the water.  Given the heat of vaporisation of $2257 \\mathrm{J/g}$ it will take $850\\mathrm{g} \\cdot 2257 \\mathrm{J/g} = 1918450\\mathrm{J}$ to vaporise the water.  The total energy required is thus $285600 \\mathrm{J} + 1918450 \\mathrm{J} = 2204050\\mathrm{J}$.  At a constant rate of 1000 J/s this will take $2204050 \\mathrm{J} / 1000 \\mathrm{J/s} = 2204.05\\mathrm{s}$ (approximately half an hour) to evaporate all of the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "This we could render into German as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Damit das gesamte Wasser verdampft, muss man zuerst das Wasser zum Kochen bringen und dann das Wasser in Dampf umwandeln.  Da die Wärmekapazität 4.2 J/g/K, die Temperaturdifferenz 80 K und Masse des Wassers 850g (=850mL) betragen, ist die Energiemenge, um das Wasser zum Kochen zu bringen $850 \\mathrm{g} \\cdot 4.2 \\mathrm{J/g/K} \\cdot 80 \\mathrm{K} = 285600\\mathrm{J}$.  Da die Verdampfungswärme für Wasser 2257 J/g lautet, wird eine Energiemenge von $850\\mathrm{g} \\cdot 2257 \\mathrm{J/g}= 1918450\\mathrm{J}$ gebraucht, um das Wasser in Dampf umzuwandeln.  Die gesamte Energiemenge ist deshalb $285600 \\mathrm{J} + 1918450 \\mathrm{J} = 2204050\\mathrm{J}$.  Da 1000 J/s von der Herdplatte dem Wasser zugeführt werden, dauert es $2204050 \\mathrm{J} / 1000 \\mathrm{J/s} = 2204.05\\mathrm{s}$ (ungefähr eine halbe Stunde), um das Wasser vollständig zu verdampfen.\n",
